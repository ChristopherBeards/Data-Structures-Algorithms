# HyperText Markup Language

Created in 1990 for the purpose of publishing and exchanging technical documents and enabling the possibility of basic styling and hyperlinks, which are connections from one page to another.

# How does HTML work?

HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author â€” these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser. This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful graphical editor to create HTML pages. | [Source](https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/whatishtml.html)
