# Structured Query Langauge

## SQL (Relational)

```Examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL, NoSQL```

- Relational databases (RDBMS)
- Table based
- Predefined schemas
- Vertically scalable
  - Increasing the horse-power of hardware
- Uses SQL for manipulating data
- Good for complex queries
- Works best for clearly defined, discrete items with exact specifications. Typical use cases are online stores and banking systems.


## NoSQL (Non-Relational)

```Examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb```

- Non-relational databases (distributed database)
- Document based
- Dynamic schemas
- Horizontally scalable
  - Increasing the databases servers in the resource pool to reduce load
- Queries are focused on collections of documents and the syntax varies
- Not ideal for complex queries
- Works best for organic data with fluid requirements. Typical use cases are social networks, customer management and web analytics systems.
