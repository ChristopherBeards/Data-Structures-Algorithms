# Node/Express Middleware (404 Page)

## Instructions

The objective of this challenge is to generate a basic Node/Express App with at least two routes. You should also implement custom middleware to display a `404 Page Not Found` if a user tries to access a route that is anything other than the ones you previously specified. Happy hacking!

- RUN: `npm install` to install all needed dependencies
- OPEN: `app.js`
- CREATE: A simple `Node/Express` app with two routes
- RUN: `nodemon` so the server updates on save
- CREATE: Custom middleware to display a `404` page if a user tires to access a route that doesn't exist
- Test your work in the browser or with Postman!
