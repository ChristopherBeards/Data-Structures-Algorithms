/* Balanced Brackets
For this problem, it's important to think about which 
data structures to use in order to achieve the functionality
we're looking for. Think about _why_ these particular data
structures were used in the solution code. Could we have used
alternative ones? What would be the resulting tradeoffs?

This function should receive a string and return true of the brackets are balanced, 
and false if they aren't.

Example:
balancedBrackets(balancedBrackets('{}[]()'));  // -> true
Testing: `jest balancedBrackets/test.js`
*/

function balancedBrackets(str) {}

module.exports = balancedBrackets;
