    The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Meta elements are typically used to specify page description,keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata. The metadata can be used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), or other web services.This meta tag basically specifies what character set is your website written with. Here is a definition of UTF-8: UTF-8 (U from Universal Character Set + Transformation Format—8-bit) is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters (called code points) in Unicode. 

    Metadata - data that describes other data.

    Unicode - an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit,or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs.

    Viewport - the area of the window in which web content can be seen.

    The width property controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the special value device-width, which is the width of the screen in CSS pixels at a scale of 100%. (There are corresponding height and device-height values, which may be useful for pages with elements that change size or position based on the viewport height.)

    The initial-scale property controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. The maximum-scale, minimum-scale, and user-scalable properties control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.

  docs and go wild.

  <br> I’m here to ensure the League of Shadow fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization. You yourself fought the
  decadence of Gotham for years with all your strength, all your resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory
  you achieved was a lie. Now, you understand? Gotham is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

  <br> Marvel

  <br> The Avengers team like you’ve never seen them before. Earths Mightiest Heroes reunite with their biggest guns at the forefront
  to take on familiar enemies and new threats alike. The instructors at Avengers Academy hope to steer these super-powered
  and highly-troubled teens in the right direction, but twists and turns abound. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the
  rest of Earths Mightiest Heroes unite to stand against the threats none can face alone.
